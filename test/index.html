The only difference is that I think this tag could also be #DignityContent, but I am not making that bid here. Perhaps when we start on Lobato, we can begin thinking about multiple-tag bids.

For             15   one thing, they provide a time in the day where             16   students have a choice to take something that they             17   really enjoy, maybe even something that they plan on             18   being part of their career.  So it keeps them engaged             19   in their learning.  An entire day without an elective,             20   without that engagement, I think is difficult on             21   students, especially those who are at risk, that are             22   already struggling academically.",

Miguel Cendejas, long-time resident of Center, CO, is testifying as to the ways he struggled in high school and, subsequently, in college. After this, he is asked about his children and the whether he and his wife, Yuri, are involved in the education of their daughters. I highlighted and annotated this passage because of the word \"obligation\" in relation to the act of study. It is signal language regarding the moral aspects of education. I take this moral language to be related to the positive actions necessary for preserving the dignity of others, especially one's children. To emphasize, I think it should be dignity criteria because it is testimony that references actions in everyday life (i.e., setting and fulfilling an obligation to study with one's children) which must be enacted to make a dignity claim possible.",

Throughout Day 1 and Day 2 we have superintendents talking at length about the obligations to students under law and the amount of resources they receive. It is clear they believe no amount of frugality will allow them to serve the students as the law requires. (I could have annotated all of Day 1, 2, 3, and 4. I mean dozens upon dozens, but I am choosing to annotate here.). The reason this question and answer pair is annotated is because of the term \"budget stabilization.\" It is, according to the Superintendent Hefty that this is a euphemism. It is one of many curious phrases that pop up throughout the testimony regarding school finance. Through use of that term, you would get no sense that human lives and their direction and their prospective growth are at stake. Thus, whenever we hear this language, a kind of threshold has been crossed. The human person and all her talents and possibilities has been lost. A kind of erasure has taken place here. Why? We are now dealing with societal values and the way the legislature funds the labor that makes those values manifest. But the attention is on making sure the budget is \"stabilized.\" And this is at the expense of the destabilization of human life. ",

I add a third consensus to this bid, because of all that has already been said by my peers.

Since remediation is high across districts in Colorado, this consists of a structural problem that needs to be systematically addressed. ",

We see that they describing how their children are missing out on an important part of education and school, they do not have access to extracurricular activities. Through these programs, students are able to explore subjects that are outside the school's main curriculum and perhaps develop an interest that may develop into a career one day. If students do not have the ability to explore different fields, then they are limited in what they are exposed to and what they may become. This is a violation of their educational dignity. I would also like to add the following paragraphs to this highlighted section (lines 12-15). This is also important because the parent is explaining how because not every student is offered the same opportunities to grow and explore they are missing out on a \"well rounded education\" and that makes the system not a uniformed one.",

I see where Raquel is going I think that adding more to the section highlighted could help. Through having more resources, the school is able to provide more opportunities to the students. With more educational opportunities students have a better chance of becoming a \"well rounded citizen\" and become productive in our society. But that requires an investment into their education and to properly invest into their educational opportunities, one needs more funding therefore funding is linked to opportunities which is linked to student achievement.

He is talking about how the school has failed in producing students who become well rounded individuals in society. He also talks about how the school fails at helping students reach their potential which is something we talk about a lot in Right to Learn. One of the reasons he gives for the school falling short is the cutting of classes.If I had to guess, they are probably cutting classes to meet a poor budget for the district. Which goes back to what we have been saying more than a few times, lack of funding for these schools has a negative effect in a student's education. This negative effect can have lasting results in a person's life by limiting the opportunities they have access to and ultimately limiting the life they may end up living. ",

He also goes on to admit that they are instead working against the mission by cutting classes. This school administrator, who is to offer opportunities for education on behalf of the state is in fact working against opportunities for education. This to me is a state violation and a disgraceful disregard of the harm to student’s future potential and opportunities.  ",

Then the highlighted portion is saying that Aurora public schools is unable to evaluate, adjust and as a result of these things, improve, because there is a lack of funding. The children attending this district are missing out on quality programming that could provide them with the tools needed to have better future, because they do not have enough resources such as funding.

This short section lists out just a few of the many challenges faced by students that migrate to the US and have language barrier.

This is a violation of their dignity because the standards that they are held to do not match the student's current circumstances and the barriers/challenges they face.

I think the list of challenges faced by students is compelling but less relevant than the response of the question on line 12 on the previous page. The response lists a state mandate that holds all children to the same required standards. This state requirement against children’s whose life’s circumstances are riddled with challenges who must achieve at the same rate, his I can say it’s a dignity violation.  Being accountable to a certain end goals set by the state without the proper support to really allow children to meet those standards makes children hostages to education instead of allowing for actual growth of potential.

    "text": "Hmm. I do think that we have something here. If I am correct the superintendent is explaining how if there was proper funding, schools would be able to adequately prepare their students for their futures by being able to ensure higher graduation rates. This person is also explaining how with more funding, the schools would be able to offer the students more opportunity and choice in their life time. To me this sounds like it could possibly fall under the equivalent expressions tag as well. This is because adequately preparing students to have a better life full of more choices sounds like respecting the student's educational dignity.",

The educational outcomes this superintendent is referring to is merely busting through state average, studnets not needign remediation if they chose college. TO me his response barely covers thorough and uniform.  To me its not strong enough to be considered EE. What I think its an important part to highlight in this text is the previous paragraph. I think we could take note of his concern for the kids who drop out of school, and who most likely face challenges that make a dignified life possible. I think it is this concern that leads to the next paragraph about the ideal situations in schools. I'm a bit lost, I think there is potential in this bid, i'm just not sure where to take it. ",

This feeling of being left out can really have impede on one's ability to learn. It makes me think of the cases we studied in Equality Rights and Education, where the young man was forced to study in the door way of the classroom. He felt left out and therefore was unable to focus on academia. Great eye Raquel!",

Due to lack of resources schools are unable to allow children to explore different paths that may benefit them as individuals more. It is the job of the schools to prepare students for the future and make sure they are ready for what comes next. But they are limiting the student's future by only fixating onto one possible outcome, college. Therefore they are violating the student's dignity because they are not providing them with the opportunity to be the best version of themselves.

I would just suggest extending it, starting from the question, are electives important, being posed on line 20 to the next page. To me the most important part of this annotation is that is setting out the criteria of why electives are important. We already established by consensus that dignity- in education require electives and I think this piece of text expands on why that is so. Electives are important because they give options to students who may feel stifled, and the give choice to explore talents. The person is providing testimony recognizing that students come with many gifts, and that it is part of their job to help them explore those gifts and this is possible through electives. Like the previous comments mention, this is of such importance for students who are geared towards a path other than college. To me this text is saying that we must provide the opportunity for students to develop their potential, even if its not academically, that is what an education must provide. ",

These are some of the reasons this suit was brought forward, and therefore of importance to hear from the parents that know and get to see the quality or lack thereof the education their children receive. If there is fear that a student might \"fall through the cracks\" then there is disregard for the child’s value as a person and a concern for the state mandated education they are to be receiving. The student\\teacher relationship is vital to the experience of educational dignity and in this testimony the teacher is seriously lacking the ability to engage meaningfully with all the students in the classes that have been assigned to them.

I am not really sure which category this would fall under. I feel like perhaps dignity content. Although the word dignity is not explicitly in use here, this passage talks about how having a quality experience in kindergarten has lasting effects all the way into adulthood. The same goes on the opposite spectrum that having a negative experience in kindergarten can effect you through high school and college. I believe that this truly shows how important it is to provide children with educational dignity as it has a rippling effect into their development as an adult.

But a child who is already disadvantaged in life and who doesn't have someone sowing quality seeds into their learning, will go onto school already being considered a failure.And that will change the way they seem themselves and the way their family sees them as well. This horrible cycle effects their social emotional health and their education which is an essential part of growing and becoming a productive member in this society. Because of the lack of quality education from the beginning they are already facing an up hill battle. This violates their dignity as it limits the opportunities for them to better themselves and become the best versions of who they are. ",

Sometimes we see dignity as individualistic, but it is more holistic in the sense that we all share this state of being within the human race. The understanding of people's dignity in a society is what creates community. In this context, investing in individuals, is recognizing that they have potential and that they are all apart of on-going community development thus being treated with dignity.\n\nDoes it match?

In this highlighted text what I’m reading is that school success is synonymous with enhancing the idivdual and the community.

Choosing among the sisters, as to who will have a chance at furthering their education is a violation of their rights.  Needing to offer equal access of opportunities is a duty to fulfill the promise of the constitution to afford its citizens the constitutional values it presents. The fact that it was posed by a legal person, if explored further through the students perspective, it would get us to a dignity argument i believe. ",

Specifically, the following: \"Needing to offer equal access of opportunities is a duty to fulfill the promise of the constitution to afford its citizens the constitutional values it presents.\" It's the \"equal access\" and \"opportunity\" part that I think makes this a kind of equivalent expression. Think about it. Why would access to opportunities need to be equal? No reason unless all were of noble birth, highest rank, and supreme value. The hypothetical in the testimony is very powerful, but I think the thing to take away is that the use of equal access to opportunity as a basis for argument is actually another way of affirming the inherent worth of all. I put forth a bid for #EquivalentExpression. ",

I feel this section talks about how essential the high school diploma has become, in order to survive in this day and age. Leading up to this section the witness discusses how the requirements for students in Pueblo are so low that the students do not qualify for any secondary education and therefore are limited on the opportunities they can have and ultimately living a limited life.This is a clear example of when schools lack the proper resources, they lack the ability to prepare students adequately enough for them to live their fullest lives.

    "text": "I guess what I was trying to say is that this expert witness is saying that a high school diploma is necessary just to BARELY make it in our society. Just to make the bare minimum in the US you need a diploma. Now just above the section I highlighted the super independent is talking about how the state is adding more graduation requirements for students in Colorado. However they are not adding any money to help support schools/students reach these new requirements. Basically, they are making it harder to graduate as they are upping the requirements to do so, but they are not providing extra support to help these students obtain this far fetched goal. One can infer that by making it harder to graduate and yet not providing support will result in less students graduating and less students being able to live in a society that insists on graduation as a bare minimum requirement to earn a wage.This is a violation of the students dignity because they won't be able to survive in society if they cannot get a diploma due to the State upping the requirements but not the resources to help them reach these expectations to graduate. Hope I clarified myself a bit here. Thank you for your feedback Profe! ",

The state is obligated to provide a thorough and uniform education. This witness describes thorough and uniform as having access to a school, materials, a quality educator and programming that not only prepares the students for their future but also provides them with the opportunities to be a well-rounded citizen. While it is the state's obligation to provide this for all students in the US, the district is unable to do so, due to lack of resources, specifically funding from the government. By refusing to put more money into education, the government is violating the student's dignity because it is ultimately providing a sub par educational experience and restricting the opportunity for these student's to become well rounded individuals in this society where education is an essential tool.

I agree with the bid for consensus because the 1st person testimony gives us insight into the way a state actor imagines his/her obligations to students when the object of the activity is meaningful participation. Perhaps the following proposition (a draft, a way of trying to sketch the lines of logic in this complex analytic activity) may help: That which fosters \"meaningful participation\" stems both from compliance with the law and from a recognition of the value of the human. This is not perfect and it may read commonsensical, but it helps to draw the line a certain way until we figure out how to draw it better.",

    "text": "This sentence comes in the mist of superintendent speaking about the needs of children in her district and detailing the problems in the building themselves that should be all encompassing to the student's educational experience. To me this sentence is saying that aside from students needing the appropriate instruction, with adequate materials they \"deserve spaces that are safe and comfortable.\" I put this annotation forward as Equivalent Expression because \"Deserve\" is calling upon a component of \"worth\" and \"worth\" in my mind is equivalent to dignity. We had mentioned that as we move forward we might find the need to double tag certain things, and I feel this might be in that category. Aside from bringing a component of dignity into the conversation of educational buildings, as part of educational experience this quote brings to mind the recognition of dignity.  I've talked about this before in an annotation in  Lane v. TN that part of dignity criteria is to be self aware of one's dignity and advocate for dignified treatment across society. In this quote, the school administrator recognizes that dignity before the student itself does, and acknowledges the need for the school/government to step up to provide the dignified experiences the student deserves.   However, I want to place a bid on Equivalent Expression. ",

It is an assertion of belief provided by a superintendent, a 1st person assertion of belief by an actor of consequence. In this assertion, Tania focuses on the word \"deserve\"--be entitled to, be worthy to have--and that is where the insight comes from for me. That word, when spoken by a person in relation to another (i.e., a second-person ethical stance) works as kind of a signal to my mind, a sign that we are in circumstances in which a dignity argument may be warranted.",

Civil rights directly feed into dignity, they do so by ensuring the  participation of all into the  larger society and protecting from infringement by government or entities or individuals  (protection and participation have been put forth as part of Dignity Criteria) The state guidelines are saying that ELL students cognitively, linguistically, psychological and emotional needs must be met.

I do not know if it is the content that we are looking for because if I recall correctly, Profe mentioned that it is suppose to have an ethical component to it but, I guess there is an ethical issue at hand when we tie a child's worth with money. It can go both ways.\nHowever, I believe this to be equivalent expresseion and not content because unlike content, there are no examples of explicit, distinguishing characteristics of dingity shown just yet. There is only the mention of how worth is viewed and that is what I think EE is. An equivalent to dignity is human worth which we see here in terms of money.\n\nNonetheless, I think their can be an argument for both and so I open the discussion up for other interpretations.",

The difference in dollars here is so huge that it's actually the difference in students who will have every opportunity laid out for them and students who will constantly have to fight for just a small portion of what others receive. That kind of disparity quickly sets up a vastly different future for each student. Since we're focusing on what the decision of funding does to a student, I think that's where the criteria piece comes in. ",

    "text": "\"...caring to create a dignified experience...\" is really interesting to me.  I have never considered a dignified educational experience to include *caring* because we don't necessarily see or talk about it when we talk about educational experiences. Caring, I believe, is a call on one's moral obligation, to go above and beyond what is expected. So for school systems, in classrooms or with teachers, to care, they are going a step forward to ensure that the students have a support system that believes that they can achieve. Because of this, I believe this falls under DignityContent",

The question by the lawyer was the challenges students face, if they transfer to schools and the witness answered that concentration of low-income students create a situation that are viewed as problems.  Challenges are paths to creative ways of thinking, problems are nuances that need to be fixed. I might also be looking too deep into the words, but I have a hunch that this is a idea propagated through districts.  It is this type of thinking that dismiss a large population of student’s potential. It is angering to know that the same system creates systemic poverty for such a large portion of the population to then not offer the opportunity to escape such realities. ",

Although I can clearly see why Maria annotated this portion of text, I think we are looking for something else. Here's my sense of the something else. Try this: Let us try and focus on 1st and 2nd person points of view. That gets us closer to the \"primary texts\" of everyday life. By first person, I mean the following: Focus on instances in which people provide testimony (e.g., description, explanation) regarding things they directly experienced. The experience can be positive or negative in terms of the recognition of dignity. By second person, I mean the following: Instances in which people provide testimony regarding things they witnessed happening to other people (e.g., \"I saw...\" or \"I heard...\"). This, at the very least, keeps us close to the \"primary text\"--e.g., actual experiences in everyday life that either recognized or failed to recognized the value of another person in an educational context. Make sense? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thank you, again, Maria, for taking the risk and annotating. ",

To my mind, what you have is a situation in which, quite clearly, the \"potential\" of the human person is recognized in a weak sense--i.e., I can contemplate it. But then there is the elaboration. There is an admission of circumstances that are so tight as to preclude the state (through human actors) from fulfilling the obligation that the initial recognition confers. It is not just a personal failing or individual indifference or one person's animosity. These things may and do actually occur, but the widespread occurrence indicates a \"structural\" problem. It is not just people misrecognizing or disregarding, it is the conglomeration of people we call a school district. Does that get closer, Maria?

    "text": "In following Profe’s earlier consensus vote I can also follow this text through the cycle of oppression ( the 4 I's) and therefore can clearly see the structural problem created in schools. Starting with Ideology- the district ideas around CSAP and what it says about the children and what it says about themselves as schools.  Then moves to Institutionalized in the way schools are funded, how districts direct schools and teachers, what/ and how is taught just to name a few. The Interpersonal playing out in how immediately children who won’t meet standards are labeled, in the teachers planning  and giving instruction differently, or less resources being available for students and ultimately peers treating each other differently, possibly creating divisions and stratifications within classroom. All this translates into Internalized, the student knowing they are treated different, and believing the are worthy of less, and even questioning their intelligence and abilities. This is a very telling annotation to the harmful effects of how the education mandate of the state is carried out, I give my vote for consensus. ",

    "text": "I would like to put this section up for a dignity criteria bid. This parent is describing the lack of resources and funding provided to her school district and how it has effected her children. In the previous sections the parent is describing the various high needs that her daughters have. Many of them are in special education programs for different learning disabilities. As a result of their disabilities these girls struggled in their educational journeys. They also did not have access to different resources that could help them flourish. One of those resources being access to after school tutoring due to a lack of money for buses. This is a violation of their dignity, because in the previous sections we learn how some of these girls loved education, and how they would love to pursue secondary education. But they cannot because their public education did not adequately prepare them to live their fullest potential.",

The  mere comparison between segregated, better off schools/districts to those less well-off with students who need more support is not a true, fair comparison. The nature of segregation in our education system can be enough for a dignity claim. ",

To children whose past and current life situations are harsh, and even dangerous, not having access to quality education can be literally fatal as they get stuck in poverty and other life reducing situations or figuratively as their aspirations and the potential to a more accessible future die.

In his life time he also served as assistant superintendent, superintendent, assistant commissioner of education and then commissioner of education for the state of Colorado, he has experience at being on different sides of the education system, here and abroad. From his response, in thorough and uniform the bare minimum is getting to a school and the time spent in school. He agrees that whatever is in the constitution is not enough no matter how we try to reconstruct the words \"thorough and uniform.\" It gives us the sense that our obligations to students should be more.

I think Dr. Eaton is providing an expert opinion, but what he is talking about is a generalization that has been culled from his (or someone else's) research. This, to me, is different than a 1st or 2nd person observation and account of experience. We are doing good work here. Raquel has done nice work here because her mind is searching for meaning and criteria for a bid. I would suggest looking closely at a few of Tania's bids.

Being aware that it is under the paragraph advocating for access to Public Transportation  with the argument being that confinement diminishes life, to me this paragraph is   equating dignity with freedom, freedom of movement, freedom of opportunity etc (just like Mandy states in the previous annotation). The sentence literally says \"dignity means opportunity to participate fully in every activity of daily life,\" which i believe adds to a definition of dignity put forth advocates of rights and dignity to the court.

I feel the later means that one is able to participate in those things that are small or looked at as unimportant like the passage lists farther down (going to the movies, diner, baseball game etc) Whereas meaningful participation, to me, means the ability to participate in voting, court access etc. ",

It is a quite powerful everyday way of saying that what makes a human organism into a human being is recognition. What is being recognized? A value that has no corresponding monetary symbol. A value that is \"seen and accepted\" because the person recognizing also has it. And I'll steal from one of the philosophical greats here (Wittgenstein). To see and accept the value of another is akin to the \"dawning of an aspect.\" All parties cross a threshold, but I think the passing of greatest consequence is the person who recognizes the other. Why? The \"non-person\" was never actually less-than-human.",

To recognize someone is to see their experience as equivalent in value to your own. In the context of recognizing someone as a participating member of our society, it means that you see them as an equal member of humanity worthy of being valued. In this way, I see \"being seen and accepted as participating members of our society\" as an equivalent expression of dignity. I put forth my vote for consensus.\n",

This is, I think, a criteria tag because it contains the signal language of \"enabling circumstances.\" Fairness, justice, and equal treatment all lead to the idea that humans must have some basic equality--i.e., equal worth or common dignity--for those principles to have integrity.

As we see with this passage. Some of those things have been upheld by the law, and so I see this as an instance of the government recognizing its own oppression against the treatment of certain folks and doing something about it. It is a dignity claim that allowed for ADA and similar legislation to pass in protection and recognition of peoples with disability rights and dignity. I think it is to our benefit to note when things shift 180 in the law in favor of dignity and civil rights. It allows me to think imaginatively about the future of educational dignity, when i'm stifled by court decisions that have come out recently that move our efforts backwards. ",

While we don't have an explicit definition here or any talk about distinguishing characteristics, we do have something of note.

By this I mean a right meant to enable the exercise of freedom that flows from the fact of a person's dignity. Even when the particular exercise may not be provided for in statute.

The black letter of the law will only get us so far, it will get us to compliance. The concept of dignity helps us interpret the law so that we do not lose sight of human promise.

(More specifically, it is deontic because it deals with duty.) Here, we have Justice Ginsburg, if I am not mistaken, give us two kinds of content: a) dignity is prohibitive, it tells us what we are not to do: \"the state has to do more than not harm them, not discriminate against them\"; b) dignity gives us an obligation that we are always bound to recognize and satisfy, we always have a duty to others: \"the state has to respect the dignity of every human being...It has to have a kind of affirmative action that's permanent...\" In my opinion, this is one of the most instructive passages in the entire court record.

The problem was not that there was some kind of method of getting to the courtroom, the problem was that there wasn't ready access made available to go into the courtroom. Having unassisted access is a violation within the ADA. App.2 Sec. 8 from the ADA states that the Nation's goals regarding people with disabilities is to ensure, for one, \"independant living.\" The only form of having access was to have assisted access which violates the claim of having the ability to be an independant person. Striving for independance on its own is a demonstration of one's own sense of dignity as well.",

And I also agree with what Frida is saying here about how independence is key. After reading the entire section, it is clear that the person who is speaking is against Lane's argument for accessibility. They are saying that the court did enough by offering to carry him up the stairs. I think if we were to take into account this passage for our dignity handbook, it would be a bit confusing for the reader. The explanations/reasoning is right but the passage doesn't back it up, instead it feels like it is refuting our argument for a dignified experience (without explicitly saying so).   ",

In the first brief we read the argument was built by demonstating that the events in question were humiliating and part of a more serious wide spred problem of class discrimination against the disabled in reguard to participation in society and the judiciary. Here they reduce that to simply argueing that if there is a \"rational reason\" for these inequtites looking at a singel instance than its purely an issue of allocation of resources. So the question for us is how can we argue for the defeance of dignity in education if met with the same argument? Just a thought exersise.",

They are less likely to have the knowledge of the justice system, voting system, and other systems that leave the human complacent to their position in society. \n\nIt is with substandard education that our dreams go to die and such education is therefore a direct injury to the human potential. \"Education makes you unfit for slavery.\"  What could our children be if slavery, poverty, unskilled jobs weren't holding them in place? \n\nI'm having a harder time answering the last one, because even slave/unskilled labor contributes\n to society.

Second, it states how the treatement of multiple punishments are detrimental to dignity, specifcally the prisoners' dignities. When it mentions \"loss of dignity\", I believe it further means a loss in one's sence of humanity. I argue this becuase it is coupled with punishments such as \"suffer unnecessary pain\" and \"shortened lifespan.\" These are extreme cases of dignity and human violations. When someone is stripped of their sence of humanity, they no longer view themselves as living the human experience which incldues having a sense of their dignity.\n\nWhat I am trying to get at is being treated in a certain way, can cause somone to question their worth: Are they even worth of anything?

Whenever we see the word exclusion it makes me think that there is a violation of one's dignity and therefore an action taking place outside the limits of dignity that one should uphold. ",

Like Diego said, having the ability to have ready access to a government building, just like having equal access to eduation, are fundamental rights and are services that are undeniably crucial for meaningful particpation in society.",

It should not be surprising that the mention appears in a concurrence by Justice Ginsburg, perhaps the one most skilled on the court in wielding the concept of dignity. (Justice Kennedy is skilled as well. I think the difference between him and Ginsburg is the Catholic social thought that underlies Kennedy's writings. Kennedy just announced his retirement from the SCOTUS today.) \n\nBack to the bid for consensus. First, read the entire paragraph. It begins by telling us that a \"body of evidence\" re: practices that deny access to public facilities and services has been amassed and analyzed by Congress. The \"national solution\" that Ginsburg references is the Americans with Disabilities Act. That legislation has been described throughout all documents as prophylactic or legislation \"formulated to prevent something.\" The ADA is described by Ginsburg as \"barrier-lowering, dignity respecting\" legislation. Here, we are at the crossroads where things blend. The ADA is law that protects the dignity of the human person. It has dignity content insofar as it lowers barriers to participation in public life, especially government. For our purposes, this is an instance of a Supreme Court justice using the term dignity to describe the effect of legislation as well as telling us that it's content is to lower barriers in order to make public life more public.

You won't find the word dignity in the Constitution, but you will find the highest of regard for the human.\n\n(Precept: late Middle English: from Latin praeceptum, neuter past participle of praecipere ‘warn, instruct,’ from prae ‘before’ + capere ‘take.’)\n\nThe only I'll take issue with (and Arliss, please push back if I am off) is the final line: \"Everyone has a sense of dignity.\" I would say that is more contingent. When I read sense, I think intra-personal. That inner sense need never take root. I would counter that hand-in-glove with the recognition that all are equal under law, all persons have a dignity (i.e., supreme worth) that we must pay deference to.

For example, it took years for undocumented students to jumpstart the Dreamer Movement, and it has been similar with other movement towards human/civil rights. Sometimes it might take experiencing indignity to get a sense of one's worth, or it might be learning how to read and write as I've seen from slave narratives. The final point being, being in an educational setting, learning, asking questions, lets us experience our educational dignity and therefore we get closer to sensing our full humanity. ",

The law acknowlegdes that everyone has dignity, that is why it remains \"accessible\" on \"impartial terms\" but, doesn't trully uphold dignity unless it is forcefully brought to the attention by the individual. When that dignity is called to attention, that is when there is a sense of dignity as Tania mentioned because not everyone has a sense of dignity. That is when the law takes advantage or dismissis the notion of \"open on impartial terms to all who seek its assistance.\" The clause's week attempt to allude to some sense of dignity is why I believe this rationale falls under DignityCriteria.",

Then it goes onto say the government will remain open and impartial to everyone. This makes me think that we are talking about the WAY in which dignity it practiced and the requirements it takes to treat a citizen in a dignified manner. Therefore it is a dignity criteria tag! ",

It reminds me that dignity should be fluid because dignity means something different to every person so the meaning always looks different. I think it's important that each part of government remain open to assistance because it protects the fluidity of people that need their dignity protected. For example, just because a judge might have ruled that literacy isn't a right does not mean another case of that nature can't be brought forth. ",

With those core rights and protections guaranteed, then everyone has the \"opportunity to participate\" \"influence, and seek redress.\" The ADA was on behalf of folks with different able bodies, but to me this portion is the criteria of a dignified existence under government; when all at the eyes of government/society have an equal value as human beings.

I believe that Maria's intuition about this post was correct and that this phrase \"feeling of just treatment\" is reminiscent of many of our discussions about dignity and is worth noting. Where this crosses into the territory of equivalent expression is tied to how we view dignity as experienced by an individual or group. In this context, we see that Congress found that there was a rampant history of discrimination against people with disabilities accessing the courts and they were denied the feeling of just treatment by the government. In essence, this is a description of a dignity-robbing experience. If we switch this situation to one that is affirming of dignity, we are left with the “feeling of just treatment” as a description of the experience of dignity. With that, I’d like to issue a bid for consensus changing this sections tag to #EquivalentExpression.\n",

I believe Mandy's intuition is good here and points us to an important part of the dignity experience- recognition. In order to have a dignity affirming experience, you must first be recognized as an individual with thoughts and feelings that are of equal merit as any other person. In the larger picture, this means recognizing differently abled people as equal in value to all other people. By doing so this affirms their dignity by giving them recognition \" seeing\" and \"hearing\" them. In the context of this brief, this argument is used to show that those with disabilities were being robbed of governmental action and in turn their dignity by not being fully able to participate in the judiciary due to lack of accommodation. At its core this argument is criteria for dignity because it shows that in order to have a dignity affirming experience you must first be given recognition, you must be seen and heard. With that, I bid for consensus that this be affirmed as #DignityCriteria ",

This sounds like something we've seen in another document where we categorized \"seen and accepted\" as equivalent expression. \n\nBut if we are concentrating on the context of the government not considering those whom they cannot \"see or hear\" then I would categorize this under Criteria as well. It is hypocritical that the government cannot take instruction from those whom it cannot see or hear when people with disabilites, such as Lane voicing his fustration with the inaccessible courtroom, there was no immidiate action taken by the government. The lack of recognition of a group of people and their dignity by the government falls under the parameters of Criteria.",

In this instance, we have a state government not in compliance with federal law. More than this, the allegation is that the state government \"intentionally failed to cause their courthouses to conform to the ADA.\" Thus, we have an instance in which there is willful disregard of the law. And that disregard is also an example of state actors flouting the federal statute. We have an instance of the state actors not following the law and, in doing so, not protecting dignity and the human person.",

My resaoning on this is that the rhetoric base of how we veiw and define dignity can be set by criteria that demonstrate dignity via a postive experience or protection made by the government,  or via a negative expreince or goverment failure to protect dignity. In this instance we see a negative exdperience that was compounded by the state's lack of protection to the individuals' dignity and failure to take action and make changes. Through this we can see further the criteria of dignity and the tie into our other anotaion group looking at where goverment falls short in protection of dignity. ",

I mentioned it in other parts of Lane of instances where the state admits its wrongdoing and lack of protection as it corresponds to persons living under its control. Upon my careful consideration of everyone else's consesus bid, I gravitated towards thinking of this anotation less as anti-dignity and more of dignity as sword, an earlier R2L vocabualry and thought, of how there are duties and responsabilites between the state and persons that can uplifted by means of that simple relatioship. Diego's comment is beautifuly reminder of how we can draw out the criteria through both means. ",

My rationale for this is that this is similar to the previous annotation where we discussed how Lane's humiliation plays a part in understanding that the criteria for dignity exists in the situation. This isn't to say that this isn't a dignity violation or \"antidignity\" rather that it may be more fruitful to see this as a situation where we can break down the details and see the criteria for dignity and how it is infringed. With that I move that this be shifted to #DignityCriteria and make a bid for consensus.",

Dignity as sun--i.e., an \"energy\" source that keeps alive the claim that humans deserve a certain kind of treatment, a certain set of rights. (We see some of this in Paust.) I see bit later someone put dignity as sword. \n\nIf we translated it into legal terms, dignity is both protection (immunity in the Constitutional sense) and positive right (a kind of affirmative power). Dignity as sun also helps us think about the \"impulse\" in human life for things like rights. The great political thinker Hannah Arendt wrote about humans having a \"right to rights.\" To me, that only makes sense if we have a sense of our supreme worth.",

Frida makes an excellent point that the palintiff was discriminated against and excluded from services but I'd like to push a bit further and put emphisis on participation. Going back to the idea of meaningful participation, the fact that George lane was excluded from participation in the court due to his physical condition brings up another situation where we can see the criteria for  dignity to be experienced, or in this case not expereineced. If he was excluded from meanigful participation then he was denied the expereince of dignity. The criteria here being that he would have expereineced dignity and had it reaffirmed if he was givien the ability to meaningfully particpate in his own trial. Dignity in this case stems from the ability to participate in and recive beneifits of the court system as provided by our rights ( due process clause). With that I move that this be put up for consensus and shifted to #DignityCriteria",

Thank you for taking the annotation a step further, Diego. \nBeing excluded from a certain service goes beyond not being able to access it because the exclusionary praction is pushed by an entity that has legal language that makes it so that all citizens can access these services. Because these are services that supposed to be made available to everyone, they are meaningful. To elaborate, the experience of being able to use these services is where meaning participation comes from.\n\nAnd so I conclude the consensus for Dignity Criteria.\n",

Anything the state compels you to do should also mean that there is ready access. Otherwise, we can start thinking about whether it is arbitrary governmental action, the reason for the Bill of Rights.\n\nWith respect to education it also matters. The \"it\" being that school attendance is compulsory up to a certain age. (This age varies across the states.) It would be ludicrous to think that a state would compel school attendance only to deaden the mind. Yet, for sectors of the population this is what we have. Remember Sumner's argument in Roberts v. City of Boston from EDFN 1000. I bring it up because the plight of certain children in schools makes me think about the central question of \"caste\" in that case. Do we still have caste?

    "text": "Dear R2L, I am making a bid for consensus on this on this tag. (Consensus is general agreement. We have set up a kind of \"golden mean\" that allows us to move forward with less than full unanimity. I say more about this below.)\n\nAllow me to clarify. Diego gave the initial annotation. He did not tag the annotation. The tag comes from me, but the initial work was done by him. I tagged this portion of text as #DignityCriteria. Why? We tag something as #DignityCriteria when parameters and/or rationale for use of the term are provided. In sum, whenever the author of a text tells us what conditions prompted the use of dignity. \n\nYou will not find the word dignity in this passage. Yet, I am making a bid for consensus because it describes the experience which prompted the litigation. I think that when those things are invoked, we get a kind of \"root criteria,\" the kind of experience closely tied to one's value as a human, the kind of experience that prompts legal action. Without this kind of experience, usually an injury to one's dignity, no claim would be made. Thus, to my mind, this passage merits a #DignityCriteria tag because it denotes the kind of everyday experience and treatment that triggers a claim for the law to protect the dignity of the person. The humiliation of Lane becomes the criteria for invoking a dignity argument.\n\nOK, here's a it on procedure. We need 4 people in agreement (barring vehement disagreement, in which case, we need 5 people to agree) to gain consensus. If you agree with my argument, go ahead and reply to this annotation with #CriteriaConsensus1 if you are the first person to do so. If you are the second, you will tag #CriteriaConsensus2 and so on until we get to the desired number. You MUST provide a rationale. Please take time writing your rationale.\n\nIf you disagree, go ahead and reply to this annotation with the #CriteriaConsensusDisagree. You MUST provide a rationale. Please take time writing your rationale.\n\nIf you are uncertain as to your decision, go ahead and respond with #NotSure and, of course, explain  your uncertainty.\n\nEvery bid for consensus deserves the response of every member of R2L.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nProfe",

    "text": "I'm in agreement with adding this to the #DignityCriteria because it fits well into one of the categories where the use of dignity detects injury or humiliation. This is clear example of government institutions treating people as means rather than as ends. By neglecting his his feelings, they neglect his innate value as human. Sometimes the absence of a dignified experience helps us define the meaning of dignity.",

    "text": "I think this is deserving of the #DignityCritera tag, I vote in favor of consensus. My rationale stems from the fact that this is one of the primary infingments of dignity that spurs this entire case. We see the various componets nessiciary to see diginity and how it is infingined. Lane was presnted with a situation where he was forced to do something that he found humiliating in oreder to make an apperance in a public corut of law. When he refused to humilate him self again he was arrested for failure to appear. At its core this situation gives us a clear represntation of an elementary experience that demonstrates dignity through its infringment. This expereince also led to the law suit that eventually became this case, In these ways I believe that this represents #DignityCritera, both in its ability to demonstrate dignity and in how it shows the initation of the legal process based on a dignity infringment.",

The 11th Amendment immunity being referenced is: \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State...\" What does this mean? It is a matter of state's rights. Meaning: states cannot be sued by citizens of other states. What do state's rights proponents want it to mean: The Fed Gov't cannot sue a state. However, \"because fundamental rights and liberties were at stake\" there was justification for abrogating (i.e., negating) that immunity. Fundamental concerns (closely related to what dignity demands in political terms) and values sway the interpretation of an amendment. ",

We cannot talk about education or any other human right with out discussing dignity the same way we cannot talk about dignity without brining up the moral actions that comes after the consideration of it. In other words, when we look at Lobato specifically, and we point out the violations that inhibit their education that transcends towards their dignity. We cannot talk about Lobato, a case of education without considering dignity.",

Board and all of the things in between, I think we can definitely draws parallels with educational rights coming out of educational dignity. I think we'll need to draw on dignity as a concept first to clarify what educational dignity means in order to show how educational rights come from that. \n\nI think it's a bit complicated as we think of Human Dignity and Human Rights and Educational Dignity and Educational Rights since the parallels between each concept have different flavors, but I think we should keep this in mind!

The character in the book reflecting on the story also mentions how Prometheus must have felt guilty stealing the fire, but did it anyhow out of the love for his creations even though he knew he would be punished. Because of his actions though, human kind was able to survive and become what it is. Maybe dignity is like fire and helps us survive in some way.",

I just added this article to the Dignity Literature library, look on page [377](https://hyp.is/Bf-7aMmXEee_jrO-KkVznA/r2l.sehd.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Status-of-the-Universal-Declaration-of-Human-Rights-in-Nation.pdf).\n\nAlso, the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court (both headquartered at The Hague in the Netherlands) both uphold human rights. The ICJ (established in 1945) handles disputes between states. The ICC (through the power of the 2002 Rome Statute) deals with the following crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression. \n\nThe Universal Declaration is a \"mother\" document and it's power comes from the accords it gave birth to. To better understand the UDHR, we have to understand the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which were entered into force in 1976. Both documents built upon the foundation of the UDHR. In sum, an international law document has to be not only signed but ratified (acceded) by a nation for it to have binding force within national borders.\n\nAnd in the end, it is everyday people like you and me that \"self-apply, \" in the words of legal scholars Hart and Sacks (1958), things like human and civil rights..",

I don't think we can say that dignity or education are absolutely honored in the U.S. We can say that we are part of the vibrant tradition that does honor those things. We must go back, at least, to the slave narratives and abolitionists here. \n\nRegarding the relationship between honor and dignity, a scholar like Waldron would talk to us about the ways that honor is used as a synonym for dignity, but that they are really distinct kinds of things. Think about the following statement: \"Her actions as a wife injured his honor.\" Can we rightfully replace honor with dignity in this sentence? I do not think so. Another scholar, Orit Kamir, would say that modern uses of honor are antithetical to dignity. Think about contemporary instances in which people do things for the \"honor of their country.\" This can often mean that the dignity of others has been dismissed. ",
