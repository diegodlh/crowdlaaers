The article, part of the Literacy, Equity + Remarkable Notes = LEARN syllabus, features the perspectives of Khaleeq and Rendell, two young men engaged in community-based social justice initiatives that counter the deficit narratives encountered in school - narratives that tell them they are not enough. Khaleeq and Rendell's counternarratives provide both a point of reflection for educators, school leaders, and community partners, as well as key considerations for the work educators do to better support the literacy development of young Black men."
