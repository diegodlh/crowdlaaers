# CROWDLAAERS
Capturing and Reporting Open Web Data for Learning Analytics, Annotation, and Education Researchers (CROWDLAAERS, pronounced “crowd layers”). As a real-time dashboard relevant to collaborative processes, CROWDLAAERS reports learning analytics associated with group, or crowd, discourse layers added via OWA to web content

# The new CROWDLAAERS release includes the following:
-Incorporates Hypothes.is HLIB Javascript library to provide expanded query capabilities to the Hypothes.is API. This allows for accessing all annotations for a URL. Also provides access to private group annotations through a user's personal Hypothes.is API token.
-Using local browser storage to provide persistence across sessions of the user’s Hypothes.is API token.
-Redesigned UI/UX separates the analysis elements in the main div from the navigation elements providing in the left nav div for a more streamed design.
-Analysis elements stored in collapsible cards in main div to improve readability. Color coded visual markers links counters to corresponding cards.
-Filtering by calendar day by clicking a day in the calendar graph (in addition to user and thread). 
-All the graphs are loaded concurrently allowing for a scrolling interaction, instead of a clicking interaction, making for a more intuitive UX.
-Improved collapsing action in the left navigation elements.
